## 🔴 Manual Method (advanced users only, no support provided)

### Step 1. Make sure you have SteamTools installed 
Download Here: https://steamtools.net/

### Step 2. Install the *plugin loader* 
You will need to figure out what it is on your own, I recommend searching on youtube for a luatools guide if you can't figure it out)
 **THEY ARE NOT AFFILIATED! IF YOU ARE FOUND TO ASK THEM ABOUT THIS YOU WILL BE PERMA BANNED FROM BOTH SIDES**

### Step 3. Install Plugin
Download the Plugin Files Latest Zip Here : <https://github.com/madoiscool/ltsteamplugin/releases>
And then go where your *steam.exe* is (steam directory, usually `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam`) then -> `plugins folder` -> `new folder` (call it whatever) then `extract the zip` content in there. 
-# To find this plugins folder easily open steam, go to top left steam button -> *plugin loader* -> plugins -> browse local files.  

### Step 4. Enable it in the *plugin loader* settings
`"Steam"` on top **left** -> *plugin loader* -> `Plugins` -> **toggle** `Luatools` -> `Save Changes`
